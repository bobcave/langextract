# LangExtract Web Application Roadmap

## Project Vision
Transform LangExtract from a Python library into a production-ready web application using Convex as the reactive backend platform, providing an intuitive interface for extracting structured information from documents using LLMs with built-in real-time updates, type-safe database operations, and simplified infrastructure.

## Architecture Overview

### Why Convex?
Convex replaces the traditional backend stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSockets, S3) with a unified reactive platform that provides:
- **Real-time database** with TypeScript schemas
- **Automatic subscriptions** for live UI updates
- **Built-in file storage** for documents
- **Scheduled functions** replacing job queues
- **Type safety** from database to frontend
- **Zero-configuration** scaling and deployment

### Hybrid Architecture
- **Convex**: Database, real-time sync, file storage, API functions
- **NextJS**: Frontend with Convex React hooks
- **FastAPI**: Python service for LangExtract operations only
- **Integration**: Convex Python SDK bridges FastAPI with Convex
